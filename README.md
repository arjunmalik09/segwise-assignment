Round 1 assignment for segwise

## Data engineer assignment

Consider you are working as a data engineer in leading data analytics company.<br>
Given the data of some of the android apps from playstore, your job is to write a pyspark job to generate insights from it.<br>
Please provide count of apps based on various combination of fields provided to you. Be as comprehensive as you can.<br>

Some examples questions we might want to answer could be:

How many apps which are free and for a certain genre and launched in a particular year etc?<br>
How many apps between certain price range, released in certain year, is adSupported and has a certain ratings and of a certain price
etc?<br>

Date file: google-play-dataset-by-tapivedotcom.csv

## Requirements:
1. You should bucket the numerical fields in reasonable number of bins.<br>
For example - you can create bins of 5 year ranges and present data as [2000-2005] etc.<br>
Similar bucketing can be done for price, ratings etc. Atleast 20 unique values should be present for a numerical field to be considered for binning.<br>
2. Counts should be as comprehensive as possible for different combinations of properties. You can filter out combinations which are smaller than 2% of total volume.<br>
3. PySpark is the framework to be used.<br>
4. Output should be in the form of a csv file with column names and corresponding values in a name=value combination separated by semicolon and counts in another column.<br>
Sample output:
Price=[4-5]; genre=Art & Design; Installs=[10000-100000], 100
This means that there are a 100 apps with a combination of price between 4-5, belonging to genre “Art & Design”, installs between 10k and 100k.<br>
Year=[2005-2010], 1000<br>
This means there are a 1000 apps released between years 2005-2010.<br>

## Assumptions:
1. You can make reasonable assumption on which of the 36 columns are important and provide better insights.<br>
2. Atleast 12 columns should be chosen and you need to consider all combinations of those 12 columns.<br>
3. All possible subsets of a set of 12 properties will be of the order of 2^12 ~ 4096. This number will go up when you consider different values for each of the columns.<br>
